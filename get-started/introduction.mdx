## About Cavok Cloud

Our service was designed for Cloud Administrators who are conscious about its provider cost & usage.

There are many opportunities to optimize costs by turning off instances in scheduled times, or by adjusting their computing power (sizing).

In these pages we'll guide you on how to make the most of our Services.

<Note>Please read our [Terms & Conditions](/legal/terms) before starting with Cavok Cloud.</Note>

## Setting up

Start by [signing up](https://cavok.dev/auth/signup) with us. You can connect social accounts or use your email.

This will create an Organization with us. One Organization can have as many Cloud Providers connected as you need.

You'll be put in our **Starter** plan, which gives a few Resources per Cloud ID, free of charge, for as long as you need.
