Refunds can be asked at our Support channels at any given time.
Requests will be considered case by case.

You can ask for a refund if you started a subscription but decided later the service wasn't a match for you,
**if you made the purchase less than 7 days before**. You will be refunded in full.

You are free to downsize on resource usage to keep your Organization within free limits.

Refunds can be asked if you subscribed to use in a secondary account, but later realized it wasn't needed,
**if you made the purchase less than 30 days before** and you have at least one other active subscription.
You will be refunded in full.

This policy does not apply for volume purchases or other custom deals.
