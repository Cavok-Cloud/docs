### General

In accordance with [GDPR laws](https://gdpr-info.eu/), any user previously registered with us can request its own removal from our system.

This will include: removal from our user database (and any social links associated) and from our Support systems.
If the request is for the entire Organization of Users, Stripe customer base information will also be removed.
**Any subscription will be immediately canceled.**

A subscription with us can be cancelled at any time, without the need to remove a Organization completely from our records.

### Instructions

A logged Administrator can cancel any subscription either with **Stripe** directly or by clicking on **Settings &gt; Manage Subscription**.

<Note>Any cancelation made directly with Stripe will be acknowledged.</Note>

A logged Administrator can exclude any User by clicking on **Manage Users &gt; Delete User**.

A logged User (non-Admin) can exclude themselves by clickin on **Manage Users &gt; Delete User**.

Please ask our Support if what you are asking is to remove an entire Organization from our system.
