<Info>
  We (Cavok Cloud) take data security seriously and align our practices with industry standards such as SOC 2 Type I.
  While we are not formally certified at this time, we have implemented controls based on SOC 2's Security principles.
</Info>

## Access Controls

- All our systems require authentication with strong, rotating credentials.
  - These are followed by internal user and subsystems.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) is in place to limit user permissions.
- Administrative access is reviewed quarterly and updated as needed.
  - Customers Administrator accounts are disabled after 3 months of inactivity, excluding root account.
- Two-factor authentication (2FA) is enforced for privileged accounts.

## Audit Logging

- We export detailed logs of key user actions (logins, permission changes, data edits/deletes).
- One Cloud Account must be set as designed Audit Trail storage
- Audit logs storage & permissions are responsabilities of our Customer.

<Tip>Audit logging is a feature of our Expert Plan</Tip>

## Encryption

- All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+.
- Data at rest is encrypted using AES-256 via our cloud provider (AWS & Azure).
- We do not store sensitive payment or personal information directly on our systems - these are handled by Stripe.

## Incident Response

- We maintain an incident response plan to quickly investigate and remediate security issues.
- In case of a breach, affected users will be notified within 72 hours.

[//]: # (- We conduct mock incident response drills to stay prepared.)

## Third-Party Risk Management

- We use trusted infrastructure and service providers who maintain their own SOC 2, ISO 27001, or similar certifications.
- All vendors are reviewed for security and compliance as part of onboarding.

## Change Management

- All code changes are reviewed and tested before deployment.
- We track changes in version control and maintain a full audit trail of updates.
- Production deployments require approval and are monitored for errors with New Relic.

## Business Continuity

- Regular backups are performed and stored securely.
- System uptime is monitored 24/7 with New Relic.
- We have recovery procedures in place in case of critical outages.

## Data Handling

- Users can request access to or deletion of their data at any time, see our [Exclusion page](/legal/exclusion).
- We follow data minimization principles and only collect what is necessary.
- Our platform is built with GDPR best practices in mind, see our [Privacy page](/legal/privacy).

## Future Plans

- We are actively working toward SOC 2 Type I compliance.
- If your organization requires formal attestation, please contact us — we’re happy to share more details or partner on a compliance roadmap.
