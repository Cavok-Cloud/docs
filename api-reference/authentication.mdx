## Token Exchange

Our API uses a well-known OAuth 2 Client Credentials workflow.

With your `clientId` and `keyId` information from the [API Keys page](https://www.cavok.dev/admin/api),
you make a request to our `oauth/token` endpoint and exchange your credentials for a Json Web Token (JWT) which gives actual access to the API.

## Authorizing Requests

The given JWToken will be put as a `Header: Authorization` following the "Bearer" mechanism:

> Header: Authorization: `Bearer {access_token}`.
