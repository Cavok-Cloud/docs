## First Steps

In order to use our API, you will need an API Key from our [Control Panel](https://www.cavok.dev/admin/api).

Keep in mind that API access is only available at one of our [paid plans](https://cavok.dev/#pricing).

API requests are limited by throttling, to avoid excessive usage from one set of keys.

All endpoints are described at the sidebar. You should learn how to Authenticate next.
