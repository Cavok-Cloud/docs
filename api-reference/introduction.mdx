## First Steps

In order to use our API, you will need an API Key from our [Control Panel](https://www.cavok.dev/admin/api).

You give it a name, and we'll generate a **Secret Key** for you.

<Warning>Keep in mind that API access is only available at one of our [paid plans](https://cavok.dev/#pricing).</Warning>

All endpoints are described at the sidebar. You should learn how to Authenticate next.

## Recommendations

We encourage you use one different API Key for any subsystem you have that might need to interact with Cavok.

That way, any unforeseen usage can be revoked and limited to that subsystem.

<Warning>Beware that an API Key have access to most Control Panel features regarding to Resources.<br />**They must be treated as a Secret**.</Warning>

<Warning>API requests are limited by throttling, to avoid excessive usage from one set of keys.</Warning>
