##

## Responses

Every endpoint has a default response object containing metadata about it, in the following scheme:

```
{
  "success": boolean,
  "message": "string", // ommitted, except when success: false
  "data": any
}
```

<Note>Property `data` will be the actual information, being either a scalar, object or array.</Note>

## Status Codes

Cavok API uses HTTP Status Codes in responses with their semantic intention.

- 200: Success
  - Success requests
  - We don't use 201-2XX
- 400: Bad Request
  - Bad input, user request error
- 401: Unauthorized
  - Token check failed
- 403: Forbidden
  - Request doesn't have the level of Authorization it needs to complete
  - When dealing with Cloud Providers, it may mean the IAM User or Role we rely on doesn't have required permissions
- 404: Not Found
  - Resource wasn't found, mostly used by `Get By Id` endpoints
- 409: Conflict
  - Operation seems well-formed but can't be completed due to conflicts within our database
  - Usually means information violates uniqueness, like a Resource name
- 422: Unprocessable Entity
  - Operation seems well-formed but can't be completed due to conflicts within our database
  - Usually means a deeper conflict or restriction, like geo-availability, might be preventing us from processing
- 500: Internal Server Error
  - An unexpected exception happend at our servers
- 501: Not Implemented
  - The request asked for an action or operation that hasn't been implemented by our services
- 502: Bad Gateway
  - Means we are experiencing temporary downtime
- 503: Service Unavailable
  - Means one or more provider we rely on (AWS, Azure, Crisp, Stripe) is currently affecting our capabilities
