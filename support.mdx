## Discord Support

We have a free server at Discord at https://discord.gg/hRzryzg3cz. Our Support Team is there, and responds to customers when available.

This is a free, always available level of support. It is not bound by a SLA.

## CRM (Crisp) Support

We have a CRM with a chat widget available at our website. Our Support Teams listen to these at business hours.
If no person is available at the time you message us, it will be picked up by the first available operator when they come online.

An AI is available: it might know how to answer a question based on our training material.

This is also a free support level, not bound by a SLA.

### Email Support

Customers with a subscription from us can contact us at support at cavok dot dev. We usually respond within 1 (one) business day.

This is the **only** support channel with a duty to answer customers ASAP and maintain SLA, as detailed in our [Terms of Service](/legal/terms).
