## The Scheduler

Our most basic Resource is a time Schedule of when to turn on and off your cloud computing services.

<Tip>Tell our **Support** if you don't see the option for a service you'd like to use it on. They'll tell if it's a priority on our Roadmap</Tip>

## Options

In our **Free Plan**, you can choose a timezone, and two options of pre-defined schedules:

- Weekdays: turn on at Monday 00:01, turn off at Friday 23:59;
- Business hours: Monday-Friday turning on at 06:00, turning off at 20:00.

With our **Paid Plans**, you can set up a Cron schedule you'd like. It can even activate multiple times a day.

<Warning>There's currently a _4 times a day_ limit on how many on/off switches can occur in a single Schedule.</Warning>

## Overlapping Schedules

We don't recommend it, but more complex or overlapping schemes can be achieved by adding two or more Schedules over the same cloud service (it counts against your Resource usage).
It would be up to you to check if it is working as you intended, because Schedulers are not aware of others running concurrently.
