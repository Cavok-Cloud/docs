## Schedule A – Service Level Agreement

This Service Level Agreement ("SLA") is attached to and made a part of the Agreement.

### 1. Availability

1.1. Cavok Cloud provides Customer access to each Service 24x7 with a goal of availability of at least 98% (the "Availability
Commitment"). Availability is measured generally for the Service.

1.1.1 Goal not being reached at any given time of month will not incur in any penalties for Cavok Cloud as this is only a desired
target.

1.2. "Availability" is ([total minutes in a calendar month – total minutes of Service Outage for a Service]/total minutes
in that calendar month) x 100.

1.3. "Service Outage" means an event that renders each Service unavailable to all or some of Customer's users,
excluding Scheduled Downtime or Excluded Downtime, at discretion of Cavok Cloud.

1.4. "Scheduled Downtime" means scheduled infrastructure changes to the Services. Scheduled Downtime will occur during
non-core business hours (0-6AM UTC).

1.5. "Excluded Downtime" means downtime caused by factors outside of Cavok Cloud's reasonable control, including any
[force majeure event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_majeure), internet services unavailability outside of Cavok Cloud's platform,
any downtime resulting from outages of third-party connections or utilities, and actions or inactions of Customer.

### 2. Support

2.1. Customer will direct all support requests to either our [Discord Support](https://discord.gg/hRzryzg3cz) or support at cavok dot cloud (the "Support"),
if subscription level implements provision for such usage.

2.2. Customer will reasonably self-diagnose each support issue with a severity level designation in accordance with the definitions
herein and specify its recommendation to Cavok Cloud in its support request.
Cavok Cloud will validate the severity designation and notify Customer of any adjustments higher or lower.

2.3. Cavok Cloud can not respond to each support request – unless stated in a custom SLA with a particular Customer - but will work
to resolution of any issue taking into consideration its severity and impact on Customer's business operations.
A resolution may consist of a workaround, fix, delivery of information or other reasonable solution to the issue.
If Cavok Cloud resolves the support request by way of a workaround accepted by Customer, the severity level may be reduced.

2.4. Following a support request, Customer will respond to Cavok Cloud's requests for additional information and implement
recommended solutions in a timely manner. For Severity 1 and 2 issues, Customer will remain reasonably accessible for
troubleshooting until the issue is resolved.
