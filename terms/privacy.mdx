**By using Cavok Cloud you agree to these [Terms & Conditions](/terms), beyond Privacy information as described here.**

Cavok Cloud doesn't sell ads, user data or any kind of profiling information.

Cavok Cloud is in accordance with [GDPR law](https://gdpr-info.eu/) and its principles.
We store indentifiable information in A) social login, B) Cloud (AWS, Azure) account numbers, and C) support cases.
These types of information are always securely stored, and operational data is anonymized.
Data processing is a [consented usage](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/) by a service provider (social network/app provider)
which authorizes its usage to [authorized apps](https://aws.amazon.com/service-terms/) abiding to their terms and conditions.
However, we do use well-known, third-party services, each with their own compliances.

External providers & services we use:
- **Crisp** is used for chat support and other systems. It might track sessions if a support case is ongoing.
- **Stripe** does need to securely authorize transactions and avoid electronic fraud, and so relies on cookies.
- **Vercel Analytics** is privately hosted and only tracks page views. It doesn't use cookies.
- **Discord** is an external service used for Support communications.
- **Mintlify** is an external service used to distribute our Documentation.

Both Stripe and Crisp are are considered **essential, first-party usage** cookies as defined by GDPR law.
Analytics is opt-in by giving full consent to our banner.

We do record support chat messages, timestamps & metadata, in order to improve our Knowledge Base.

You can ask for your data [to be excluded here](/terms/exclusion).

We **consciously** made the design choice of asking for customer-side IAM Roles & logging permissions in order to enhance information security.
You can review user permissions, boundary and issues that may arise from it without sharing any confidential information with us.
