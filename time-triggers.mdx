## Execution Time

Any one of our Resources will have a time to **start** and to **end**. These are affected by two things:

- _Timezone_, decided at Resource creation
- _Tolerance_, in time, for the action to be taken

**Tolerance** is what our current cloud systems use to distribute our workload, **in minutes**;
so a Scheduler set to start at 00:00 usually does at 00:01 ~ 00:04.

<Info>This is known as the ["Thundering Herd"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem) problem,
  and it is a consideration for every Cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, ...)</Info>

<Warning>
  Also note, there's (currently) **no SLA guaranteeing execution**.

  Our service is very reliable, but we don't recommend using Schedulers with no designed tolerance for mission-critical systems.
</Warning>

These tolerance not only help with ensuring **the action will take place eventually**, but often Cloud providers need _a lot of time_ to start,
stop or modify their instances anyway. Usually, snapshots are taken and stored, database backups take place, diff logs are transfered between replicas.
Until changes are actually in effect, resources are usually charged at their previous levels.

One of the reasons we recommend turning Account Logging on is for you to be able to check on them and see their day to day timings.
It will be registered when the action took place and when their status was actually confirmed to have changed.

## Editing

Schedules & Adjusters are create-only; if you need to change a planned schedule, delete the Resource and create them again.

## Planned Features

Regarding execution, we currently are working in two features. They are:

- _Precise timing_: we'll strive to start execution at the planned time, within seconds.
- _Alerts_: in case of a long error about starting or stopping a Resource, with significant cost involved,
we'll send alerts to you over other channels.
