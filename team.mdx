## Manage Users

At our Admin sidebard, there is an [Users Page](https://cavok.dev/admin/manage-users),
in which a list of Users added to your Organization.

There are 3 levels of Users:

- Root
  - First user, created the Organization and is a special type of Administrator. Cannot be deleted.
- Admin
  - Users with this role have permissions to change the Organization's Users, Subscription Plan and other sensitive information.
- Standard User
  - Users with access to Control Panel and Resource editing, but with a few constraints.

<Note>Users receive an invitation by email.</Note>

<Note>Users may have their permissions changed between Standard/Admin (but not Root).</Note>
