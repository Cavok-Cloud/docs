## Cloud Accounts Page

At our Admin sidebard, the first menu entry is [Cloud Accounts](https://cavok.dev/admin/cloud-access),
in which a list of currently connected Cloud Accounts have been added to your Organization.

There's no limit on connected Accounts: we want you to have your entire cloud infrastructure under a single Organization.
Each new added Account has its own free tier usage.

### AWS Permissions

The most important part is how to enable Cavok Cloud to access your Cloud Account, securely.

With AWS, there's two ways to give us permissions: allowing one IAM User of our own to assume an IAM Role on your account ("Assume Role"),
or by creating an IAM User at your side, creating token credentials for it and passing it down to us ("Access Credentials").

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user-shield" title="Assume Role">
    This is the **recommended way** to give us permission, as it is a AWS Well-Architecture practice.

    Our internal IAM User integrates with AWS by assuming an IAM Role on your end, and getting temporary credentials.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Access Credentials">
    This is the "old" way of connecting directly to an AWS Account.

    You create an IAM User on you end, create a Security Credential with an

    `AWS Access Key ID` & `AWS Secret Access Key`

    and trust those keys with us.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Option 1: AWS Assume Role

After you add the basic information about your Cloud Account, it will be shown at the Account list as this:

    ![Account Item](/images/new-account-item.png)

The question mark (?) shows we haven't confirmed this Account yet.

Click on its next step: "Instructions".

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="clipboard-list-check" title="Install instructions">
  We have an easy AWS CloudFormation Stack Deploy button, ready for you to use.

  <img noZoom src="/images/deploy-stack.png" />

  It will open a CloudFormation page within your logged in AWS Account. This stack creates an IAM Role with our
  necessary permissions, and you won't have to pass on any other credential.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="vial" title="Test your access">
  This button will open a modal and make a sucession of tests to your Account.

  In case it succeeds, your Account will be confirmed and you can create Resources for it. In case of failure,
  check the modal logs for details on where to investigate. Contact Support if needed.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

### Option 2: AWS Access Key & Secret

If you enter your credentials with the option "AWS Access Key" when creating a new Account,
we will use those to connect with it.

You will have to create the IAM User on your own. Check our [Access Details Page](access-details) for required permissions.
Then click on the "Test" icon to check everything is in place.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="vial" title="Test your access">
    This button will open a modal and make a sucession of tests to your Account.

    In case it succeeds, your Account will be confirmed and you can create Resources for it. In case of failure,
    check the modal logs for details on where to investigate. Contact Support if needed.
  </Accordion>

## Use our Tools

After an Account is properly connected, you can add our Resources to better control your instances usage.
