## Cloud Accounts Page

At our Admin sidebard, the first menu entry is [Cloud Accounts](https://cavok.dev/admin/cloud-access),
in which a list of currently connected Cloud Accounts have been added to your Organization.

There's no limit on connected Accounts: we want you to have your entire cloud infrastructure under a single Organization.
Each new added Account has its own free tier usage.

### AWS Permissions

The most important part is how to enable Cavok Cloud to access your Cloud Account, securely.

With AWS, there's two ways to give us permissions: allowing one IAM User of our own to assume an IAM Role on your account ("Assume Role"),
or by creating an IAM User at your side, creating token credentials for it and passing it down to us ("Access Credentials").

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="user-shield" title="Assume Role" defaultOpen={true}>
    This is the **recommended way** to give us permission, as it is a AWS Well-Architecture practice.

    Our internal IAM User integrates with AWS by assuming an IAM Role on your end, and getting temporary credentials.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Access Credentials" defaultOpen={true}>
    This is the "old" way of connecting directly to an AWS Account.

    You create an IAM User on you end, create a Security Credential with an

    `AWS Access Key ID` & `AWS Secret Access Key`

    and trust those keys with us.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### AWS Assume Role

After you add the basic information about your Cloud Account, it will be shown at the Account list as this:

<Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
  Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
  don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
  your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
  successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
  of the repo.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
  [Commit and push your changes to
  Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
  for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
  the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
  update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).

## Use our Tools

After an Account is properly connected, you can add our Resources to better control your instances usage.
